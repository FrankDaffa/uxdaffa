    overview: 'Dynatables was born from the need to make complex data more accessible and actionable for enterprise users. Traditional data tables were static and overwhelming, leading to poor user adoption and decision-making delays.',
    challenge: 'Enterprise users were struggling with static data tables that contained hundreds of attributes, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly. The existing interface had a 23% task completion rate and users spent an average of 8 minutes trying to locate specific data points.',
    solution: 'I designed an intelligent table system that learns from user behavior and contextually surfaces the most relevant attributes. The solution included smart filtering, personalized column arrangements, and progressive disclosure patterns.',

      'Increased task completion rate from 23% to 87%',
